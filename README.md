# Arxiv_Research_Assistant

The Arxiv Research Assistant is a tool designed to assist researchers in downloading PDF files from arXiv and extracting relevant information from them. This README provides instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and using the program.

Setup
1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate
2. Clone the Repository
Clone the Arxiv Research Assistant repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Daryldactyl/Arxiv_Research_Assistant.git
3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
cd Arxiv_Research_Assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once you have set up the environment and installed the dependencies, you can use the Arxiv Research Assistant to download PDF files from arXiv and extract relevant information. Here's how to use the program:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Activate the virtual environment (if you created one).
